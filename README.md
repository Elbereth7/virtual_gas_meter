# Virtual Gas Meter for Home Assistant

## Overview

The **Virtual Gas Meter** is a Home Assistant integration designed to estimate gas consumption using an average gas usage rate. It provides a virtual sensor that mimics a real-life gas meter by calculating gas consumption based on boiler runtime. Additionally, users can manually update the sensor with real-life gas meter readings to improve accuracy over time.
## Features

- **Virtual Gas Meter Calculation**: Estimates gas consumption using time-based calculations.
- **Sensor Integration**: Creates Home Assistant sensors to track gas usage and historical updates.
- **Manual Data Entry**: Allows users to input real gas meter readings periodically.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Uses Home Assistant's history stats to calculate active heating intervals.
- **Logging & Persistence**: Stores and retrieves gas meter data using a file-based system.
- **Provides configurable options** to customize gas calculation parameters.
- **Implements Home Assistant services** to trigger manual gas updates and read stored data.
- **Supports Home Assistant's UI-based configuration flow**.

## Installation

### Install via HACS (Recommended)
1. **Ensure HACS is installed** in your Home Assistant instance.
2. **Add the Custom Repository:**
   - Open HACS in Home Assistant.
   - Navigate to `Integrations` and click the three-dot menu.
   - Select `Custom Repositories`.
   - Add the repository URL: `https://github.com/Elbereth7/virtual_gas_meter`.
   - Choose `Integration` as the category and click `Add`.
3. **Install the Integration:**
   - Search for `Virtual Gas Meter` in HACS and install it.
   - Restart Home Assistant to apply changes.
   
### Manual Installation
1. Download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. Copy the `custom_components/gas_meter` folder into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

### Adding the Integration
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. Click **"Add Integration"** and search for `Virtual Gas Meter`.
3. Select your boiler switch (`switch.xxx`).
4. Optionally, enter an average gas consumption per hour (mÂ³) and the latest gas meter state.
5. Click **"Submit"**.
   
### Services

#### `trigger_gas_update`
This service allows users to manually enter a real-life gas meter reading. This is crucial to keep the virtual gas meter accurate over time.

- **Why use this?**
  - The virtual gas meter **estimates** gas consumption using the average rate.
  - By entering real readings, the system **adjusts** the average gas consumption for better accuracy.
  - If no real readings are provided, the virtual gas meter relies on the initial average entered during installation (or a default value if none was provided).
  
- **Fields:**
  - `datetime`: Timestamp for the gas reading (format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`).
  - `consumed_gas`: Gas meter reading in cubic meters (`mÂ³`).

- **Service Call Example (via Developer Tools > Services):**

  ```yaml
  service: gas_meter.trigger_gas_update
  data:
    datetime: "2025-02-12 15:51"
    consumed_gas: 4447.816
  ```

#### `read_gas_actualdata_file`
This service reads the stored gas meter data file.

- **Service Call Example (via Developer Tools > Services):**

```yaml
service: gas_meter.read_gas_actualdata_file
```
## Code Overview

The integration consists of the following files:

### `__init__.py`
- Handles the initialization and setup of the integration, including data persistence and service registration.

### `sensor.py`
- Implements:
  - `CustomTemplateSensor` for dynamic gas calculations.
  - `GasDataSensor` to track stored gas usage data.
  - `CustomHistoryStatsSensor` for boiler operation tracking.

### `config_flow.py`
- Manages Home Assistantâ€™s UI-based configuration flow.

### `datetime_handler.py`
- Handles date-time parsing and conversion.

### `file_handler.py`
- Manages asynchronous file operations for gas consumption data.

### `gas_consume.py`
- Stores gas consumption records using a custom list-based class.

### `manifest.json`
- Defines integration metadata, dependencies, and requirements.

### `services.yaml`
- Documents the available Home Assistant services for interacting with the integration.

### `translations/en.json`
- Provides user-friendly descriptions for the configuration flow.


## Usage

1. **Monitor gas consumption** in Home Assistant's dashboard.
2. **Trigger gas updates manually** using `trigger_gas_update` if needed.
3. **Read stored data** with `read_gas_actualdata_file`.
4. **Customize calculations** by adjusting the boiler entity and average consumption settings.
